This is the firmware for the SPIDriver.
It uses the (MyForth)[http://www.kiblerelectronics.com/myf/myf.shtml] compiler written by
Charley Shattuck and Bob Nash.

To compile the fonts go into ``st7735s``
and unpack the (IBM plex OpenType)[https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases] font set.
then run ``mkfont.py``.
